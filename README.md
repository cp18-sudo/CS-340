# CS 340 Module Eight Journal  
### Data Dashboard and CRUD Application Portfolio Submission  

---

## Overview  
This submission highlights my final work from **CS 340: Client/Server Development**, focusing on building and connecting a data dashboard using a CRUD Python module.  
These projects demonstrate my ability to design maintainable, readable, and adaptable code while connecting Python applications to databases and visualizing real-time data.  

The submission includes:  
- **Final Dashboard Code:** The completed Dash web application that visualizes data stored in MongoDB.  
- **CRUD Python Module:** A Python class that handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to interface with the database.

## Reflection  

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
I write maintainable programs by organizing my code into logical functions and using clear variable names that make the purpose of each section easy to understand.  
For this project, my CRUD Python module was reusable across multiple parts of the dashboard, which made testing and debugging simpler.  
The modular structure also makes it easy to adapt for future projects that require database connectivity or dashboard integration.  
Working this way saves time and makes collaboration with other developers more efficient.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and then breaking them into smaller, manageable tasks.  
For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by analyzing how the database needed to store animal data and how the dashboard would retrieve and visualize that information.  
Compared to previous courses, this project required more focus on integrating front-end and back-end systems.  
In the future, I would use this same approach — starting with database design and modular architecture — to handle similar client requests efficiently.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
Computer scientists solve problems using data and technology to improve systems, automate processes, and make better decisions.  
In this project, my work helps a company like Grazioso Salvare manage and visualize animal data in a clear and accessible way.  
By connecting data storage with interactive visual dashboards, computer scientists enable organizations to quickly find insights that can improve their operations.  
This kind of work matters because it shows how technology can be used to support real-world decision-making and improve efficiency.
